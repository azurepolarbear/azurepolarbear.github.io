# Traveling Triangles

Starting from a random initial position, a triangle generator creates a trail of randomly colored triangles,
where each triangle must share a point with the next one.
Older triangles slowly fade away, growing fainter and fainter as time goes on.
There can be multiple triangle generators in one piece, and the number of triangle generators on the screen is random.
