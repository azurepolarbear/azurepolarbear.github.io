# azurepolarbear | code artist

azurepolarbear (sometimes known as brittni watkins) is a generative artist who is
passionate about creating beautiful things with code and creating beautiful code.
She strives to discover striking visuals that can be created from logic and logical forms,
such as geometric shapes and mathematical equations.
She takes as much pride in the readability and cleanliness of her code as she does in the output it produces.

azurepolarbear has been publishing NFTs since 2022.
She loves generative art NFTs for their ability to preserve
a single output of a random, generative algorithm,
and she loves the process of minting generative NFTs for the element of
surprise and joy that comes with every mint.

Through her work as an artist, programmer, and educator, azurepolarbear hopes to
inspire and encourage others to learn how to program and explore the amazing capabilities of code.
Her philosophy is that art, art education, and computer science education should be
available and accessible to all.
