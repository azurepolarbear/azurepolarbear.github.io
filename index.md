# azurepolarbear | code artist

azurepolarbear (sometimes known as [**brittni watkins**](https://blwatkins.github.io/))
is an algorithmic artist who is passionate about creating beautiful things with code
and creating beautiful code. She strives to discover striking visuals that can be created
from logic and logical forms, such as geometric shapes and mathematical equations.
She takes as much pride in the quality of her code as she does in the output it produces.

With a bachelor’s degree in creative computation, azurepolarbear has been creating art with code
for more than a decade. She is a perpetual student, constantly exploring and learning about
the intersection of creative practice, technical application, and technological innovation.

azurepolarbear has been publishing NFTs since 2022. She loves code art NFTs for their
ability to preserve a single output of a random, generative algorithm, and she loves the process
of minting NFTs for the element of surprise and joy that comes with every mint.
She firmly believes in the ethos and potential of blockchain technology,
most notably decentralization and public, digital provenance.

Through her work as an artist, programmer, and educator, azurepolarbear hopes to
inspire and encourage others to learn how to program and explore
the amazing capabilities of code. Her philosophy is that art, art education,
and computer science education should be available and accessible to all.

The applications of computer programming are numerous and varied; there is space for everyone.

You can purchase stationery and gifts featuring azurepolarbear's work

***There is beauty in code, and code can make beautiful things.***
