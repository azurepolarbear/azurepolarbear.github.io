title: "How do you make art with code?"

What is code?

Code is our way of communicating with computers.
It's an intermediary language between what we understand--words, letters, and numbers--and what computers understand--electrical signals that can either be off or on.

Code is used in an almost infinite number of applications.
It's used in the operating systems and applications in our TVs, phones, computers, tablets, and smart appliances.
The bluetooth technology in our speakers and headphones is code.
Wi-Fi and internet were built with code.
Every website we visit is built with code.
This blog is built with code.
Video games, video game consoles, cameras, watches, medical equipment; they're all created with code.

Code is used in so many amazing ways, and sometimes, it can also be used to make art.

On X, [Jordan Lyall](https://x.com/JordanLyall/status/1876778588168487397) said, "There’s something profoundly human about art generated through code."

I agree completely.
We took a machine that was built only to process electrical signals to perform calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
As it evolved, we engineered more and more ways to create with it, to pull beautiful forms and sounds from it when it wasn’t designed for us to do so.
It’s absolutely amazing.

The history of making art with computers is inextricably tied to the history of computers themselves.
Amazing leaps and bounds in computer development have been made in efforts to make art more beautiful, more entertaining, more realistic, easier to distribute, easier to process.

It's incredible.

So, how do we do it?
