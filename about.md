# about azurepolarbear

Hello! I’m azurepolarbear! I make non-fungible tokens (NFTs)! These NFTs may be a little different from what you're used to. They’re not profile pictures (PFPs); or video game assets; or unique, singular pieces of art (1 of 1). The NFTs I love to create are generative art, art created using an algorithm that incorporates randomness. My NFTs are the outputs of creative code that I’ve written. Please keep in mind that the information I provide regarding blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs is <u><b>NOT</b> financial advice</u>.

Each time you run my code, you get a unique result. When you purchase one of my NFTs, you purchase your own unique output of my code. Not only that, but you can run the code and interact with the program in your web browser!

I love writing code, and I love teaching people about code and sharing my code with them. If you’re a fellow programmer or generative artist, I’m excited to learn from you and learn with you as I develop new projects and improve old ones. If you’re not a developer, I hope you enjoy going through the process with me and seeing the end result of the code I create.

Web3 is not always the friendliest place. Just like a lot of other places on the web, there are scams, and there is spam, and there are people whose main concern is how much money they can make. I hope you enjoy the time you spend in this little corner I’m creating where we write code that makes pretty pictures we can share with the world.
