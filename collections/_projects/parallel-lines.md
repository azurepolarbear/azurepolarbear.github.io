*parallel lines* is an original code art algorithm; each run of the code produces a random visual output.
The *parallel lines* program creates a random number of vertical lines. 
Lines start from the top of the screen and have a random color, length, and thickness.

Each set of vertical lines has its own set of properties.
Some lines may be created with one solid color, and some lines may be created with a gradient.

*parallel lines* is currently in development.

*parallel lines* was created with TypeScript and p5.js.
